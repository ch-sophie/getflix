## The mission:
In this exercise, we created a Streaming site in html / css, javascript and php.

We were inspired by Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Youtube...  The goal is to display a catalogue of movies and TV series.

#### Where: BeCode Brussels
#### When: 5 August 2022
#### Technologies used: HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP

### Must-have features:
- A session system: registration, connection / disconnection.
- Different rights: registrants have the right to comment on the content. You can add other rights depending on the different types of users.
- Include a search bar and sort by filters. 
- Make a secure code. 
- Deploy the site. PHP is not supported by github, find free alternatives.

### Nice-to-have features:   
- Management of lost passwords.   
- Back office for user and comment management (CRUD).   
- Create a page or section that displays the top movies with the movie db API.  
- Integrate a newsletter with Mailchimp.  

### The project: BesTube
We decided to create a platform to watch the best videos on Youtube, according to us. The name is **BesTube**. 
We wanted to create an easier way to find only the best of Youtube with a good catalogue and functional filters.
The videos are divided in categories (as a playlist) and only registered users can comment.  

To do it, we used the **Youtube Data API** connected with PHP language.    

For non-registered users, they will have a preview of the website and can only watch the originals videos.   
### Team roles*:
- Backend: Sophie and Arianna
- Frontend: Bhama
- Project manager: Jilani

*Note that the roles were defined to have some structure at the start of the project but that each person worked on both frontend and backend tasks.
