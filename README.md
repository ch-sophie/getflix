### The project: BesToBe
We decided to create a platform to watch the best videos on Youtube. The name is **BesToBe**. 
We wanted to create an easier way to find only the best of youtube with a good catalog and functionals filters.
The videos are divided in categories (as a playlist) and only registered users can comment.  

To do it we used the **Youtube Data api** connect with PHP language.
